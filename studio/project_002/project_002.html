        <div>
            <p>
                The sign said ELECTRIFIED FENCE 10,000 VOLTS DO NOT TOUCH,
                but Nedry opened it with his bare hand, and unlocked the gate,
                swinging it wide. He went back to the Jeep, drove through the gate,
                and then walked back to close it behind him.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Now he was inside the park itself, no more than a mile from the
                east dock. He stepped on the accelerator and hunched forward over
                the steering wheel, peering through the rain-slashed windshield as he
                drove the Jeep down the narrow road. He was driving fast—too fast—
                but he had to keep to his timetable. He was surrounded on all sides by
                black jungle, but soon he should be able to see the beach and the
                ocean off to his left. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                This damned storm, he thought. It might screw up everything.
                Because if Dodgson’s boat wasn’t waiting for him at the east dock
                when Nedry got there, the whole plan would be ruined. Nedry
                couldn’t wait very long, or he would be missed back at the control
                room. The whole idea behind the plan was that he could drive to the
                east dock, drop off the embryos, and be back in a few minutes, before
                anyone noticed. It was a good plan, a clever plan. Nedry’d worked on
                it carefully, refining every detail. This plan was going to make him a
                million and a half dollars, one point five meg. That was ten years of
                income in a single tax-free shot, and it was going to change his life.
                Nedry’d been damned careful, even to the point of making Dodgson
                meet him in the San Francisco Airport at the last minute with an
                excuse about wanting to see the money. Actually, Nedry wanted to
                record his conversation with Dodgson, and mention him by name on
                the tape. Just so that Dodgson wouldn’t forget he owed the rest of the
                money, Nedry was including a copy of the tape with the embryos. In
                short, Nedry had thought of everything.

        <div>
            <p>
                Except this damned storm.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Something dashed across the road, a white flash in his headlights. It
                looked like a large rat. It scurried into the underbrush, dragging a fat
                tail. Possum. Amazing that a possum could survive here. You’d think
                the dinosaurs would get an animal like that.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Where was the damned dock?
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                He was driving fast, and he’d already been gone five minutes. He
                should have reached the east dock by now. Had he taken a wrong
                turn? He didn’t think so. He hadn’t seen any forks in the road at all.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Then where was the dock?
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p> 
                It was a shock when he came around a corner and saw that the road
                terminated in a gray concrete barrier, six feet tall and streaked dark
                with rain. He slammed on the brakes, and the Jeep fishtailed, losing
                traction in an end-to-end spin, and for a horrified moment he thought
                he was going to smash into the barrier—he knew he was going to
                smash—and he spun the wheel frantically, and the Jeep slid to a stop,
                the headlamps just a foot from the concrete wall.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                He paused there, listening to the rhythmic flick of the wipers. He
                took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. He looked back down the
                road. He’d obviously taken a wrong turn somewhere. He could retrace
                his steps, but that would take too long.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                He’d better try and find out where the hell he was.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                He got out of the Jeep, feeling heavy raindrops spatter his head. It
                was a real tropical storm, raining so hard that it hurt. He glanced at
                his watch, pushing the button to illuminate the digital dial. Six
                minutes gone. Where the hell was he? He walked around the concrete
                barrier and on the other side, along with the rain, he heard the sound
                of gurgling water. Could it be the ocean? Nedry hurried forward, his
                eyes adjusting to the darkness as he went. Dense jungle on all sides.
                Raindrops slapping on the leaves.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                The gurgling sound became louder, drawing him forward, and
                suddenly he came out of the foliage and felt his feet sink into soft
                earth and saw the dark currents of the river. The river! He was at the
                jungle river!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Damn, he thought. At the river where? The river ran for miles
                through the island. He looked at his watch again. Seven minutes gone.
                “You have a problem, Dennis,” he said aloud.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                As if in reply, there was a soft hooting cry of an owl in the forest.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Nedry hardly noticed; he was worrying about his plan. The plain
                fact was that time had run out. There wasn’t a choice any more. He
                had to abandon his original plan. All he could do was go back to the
                control room, restore the computer, and somehow try to contact
                Dodgson, to set up the drop at the east dock for the following night.
                Nedry would have to scramble to make that work, but he thought he
                could pull it off. The computer automatically logged all calls; after
                Nedry got through to Dodgson, he’d have to go back into the
                computer and erase the record of the call. But one thing was sure—he
                couldn’t stay out in the park any longer, or his absence would be
                noticed.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Nedry started back, heading toward the glow of the car’s headlights.
                He was drenched and miserable. He heard the soft hooting cry once
                more, and this time he paused. That hadn’t really sounded like an
                owl. And it seemed to be close by, in the jungle somewhere off to his
                right.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                As he listened, he heard a crashing sound in the underbrush. Then
                silence. He waited, and heard it again. It sounded distinctly like
                something big, moving slowly through the jungle toward him.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <p>
                Something big. Something near. A big dinosaur.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Get out of here.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Nedry began to run. He made a lot of noise as he ran, but even so
                he could hear the animal crashing through the foliage. And hooting.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                It was coming closer.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Stumbling over tree roots in the darkness, clawing his way past
                dripping branches, he saw the Jeep ahead, and the lights shining
                around the vertical wall of the barrier made him feel better. In a
                moment he’d be in the car and then he’d get the hell out of here. He
                scrambled around the barrier and then he froze.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                The animal was already there.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                But it wasn’t close. The dinosaur stood forty feet away, at the edge
                of the illumination from the headlamps. Nedry hadn’t taken the tour,
                so he hadn’t seen the different types of dinosaurs, but this one was
                strange-looking. The ten-foot-tall body was yellow with black spots,
                and along the head ran a pair of red V-shaped crests. The dinosaur
                didn’t move, but again gave its soft hooting cry.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Nedry waited to see if it would attack. It didn’t. Perhaps the
                headlights from the Jeep frightened it, forcing it to keep its distance,
                like a fire.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                The dinosaur stared at him and then snapped its head in a single
                swift motion. Nedry felt something smack wetly against his chest. He
                looked down and saw a dripping glob of foam on his rain-soaked
                shirt. He touched it curiously, not comprehending.…
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                It was spit.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                The dinosaur had spit on him.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                It was creepy, he thought. He looked back at the dinosaur and saw
                the head snap again, and immediately felt another wet smack against
                his neck, just above the shirt collar. He wiped it away with his hand.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Jesus, it was disgusting. But the skin of his neck was already
                starting to tingle and burn. And his hand was tingling, too. It was
                almost like he had been touched with acid.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Nedry opened the car door, glancing back at the dinosaur to make
                sure it wasn’t going to attack, and felt a sudden, excruciating pain in
                his eyes, stabbing like spikes into the back of his skull, and he
                squeezed his eyes shut and gasped with the intensity of it and threw
                up his hands to cover his eyes and felt the slippery foam trickling
                down both sides of his nose.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Spit.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                The dinosaur had spit in his eyes.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Even as he realized it, the pain overwhelmed him, and he dropped
                to his knees, disoriented, wheezing. He collapsed onto his side, his
                cheek pressed to the wet ground, his breath coming in thin whistles
                through the constant, ever-screaming pain that caused flashing spots
                of light to appear behind his tightly shut eyelids.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                The earth shook beneath him and Nedry knew the dinosaur was
                moving, he could hear its soft hooting cry, and despite the pain he
                forced his eyes open and still he saw nothing but flashing spots
                against black. Slowly the realization came to him.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                He was blind.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                The hooting was louder as Nedry scrambled to his feet and
                staggered back against the side panel of the car, as a wave of nausea
                and dizziness swept over him. The dinosaur was close now, he could
                feel it coming close, he was dimly aware of its snorting breath.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                But he couldn’t see.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                He couldn’t see anything, and his terror was extreme.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                He stretched out his hands, waving them wildly in the air to ward
                off the attack he knew was coming.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                And then there was a new, searing pain, like a fiery knife in his
                belly, and Nedry stumbled, reaching blindly down to touch the ragged
                edge of his shirt, and then a thick, slippery mass that was surprisingly
                warm, and with horror he suddenly knew he was holding his own
                intestines in his hands. The dinosaur had torn him open. His guts had
                fallen out.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Nedry fell to the ground and landed on something scaly and cold, it
                was the animal’s foot, and then there was new pain on both sides of
                his head. The pain grew worse, and as he was lifted to his feet he
                knew the dinosaur had his head in its jaws, and the horror of that
                realization was followed by a final wish, that it would all be ended
                soon.
